//   description: `I‚Äôm a second-year Computer Engineering major at Georgia Tech, fascinated by how AI/ML can be integrated with hardware design to build cutting-edge solutions. My journey started with a small robotics project in high school, and ever since, I‚Äôve been hooked on the idea of shaping technology to solve real-world challenges.
  
//   Beyond academics, I‚Äôm deeply involved in community work as the founder of MOMA, a nonprofit addressing food insecurity. These experiences have helped me develop strong leadership and collaboration skills. When I‚Äôm not coding or volunteering, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies and exploring how software and hardware can seamlessly merge.`,
